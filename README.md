# Week-12

# Labs: reusable components with Styled Components Library
This week you'll build the same reusable components as last week. BUT this time you should build them with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics). 

```
<Header />
<Footer />
<Button />
<ProfileImage />
<SearchBar />
<Card />
<CookieAlert />
<Loader />
```

Create the component and style it according to the [designs](https://www.figma.com/file/TvzlqGmdny9sJEBz82MwX9/Components-Design-Layouts---Technigo?node-id=0%3A1). Make it take in props so it becomes reusable. Such as `<Header title="Welcome to my site"/>` You can build and store them in CodeSandbox or on Github. Try the component you've built out with passing different props to it and see how it changes. What parts could be dynamic and what parts works best as static?

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
